There have been NFT ticketing platforms already, but almost all of them require their users to have a web3 wallet. This creates an entry barrier for new users. In the traditional web2 ticketing systems, tickets are generated with QR codes which can be forged or replicated and couldn't be verified easily on online events.

Now events hosted on any platform can have their shortlisted participants claim tickets on this platform. Like other popular Web2 platforms, users can log in using their Google credentials. They can host their own events and upload shortlisted participants' email address lists, all without paying any gas fee or the hassle of understanding web3 wallet. Shortlisted users can then claim these NFT tickets just with a single click. These NFTs can be used to verify users and provide access not only to offline events but also to online token-gated meetings.
